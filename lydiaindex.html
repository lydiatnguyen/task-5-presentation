# "Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains." -Karl Marx
...
"we have nothing to lose but our visual chains"
I am going to make a powerpoint on digital design and advertisements' impact on us. 
It is going to discuss persuasive technologies, nudging, advertising, and our 'attention economy'.
I am going to include information from Jean Kilbourne, Tristan Harris, Irene Au? and try to link this to urban design and certain sociologists.
